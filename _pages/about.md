## About steakscience

*steakscience* is a blog about technology, design, and the culture around them. Sometimes, the blog does get off-topic or personal. But hey, those are the most interesting posts.

The blog is a way to force myself to write more. Writing is structured thinking, so through writing, I am developing my thoughts and giving them more depth and consistency. 

The huge plus is that it’s very fun to share my thoughts and photos.

## About me

For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved gadgets.

Now, I’m studying Industrial Design and Interaction Design at the University of Washington.

Next, I’ll be exploring the intersection of those two fields and designing interactive objects.

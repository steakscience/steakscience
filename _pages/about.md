## About steakscience

*steakscience* is a blog about technology, design, and the culture around them. Sometimes, the blog does get off-topic or personal. But hey, those are the most interesting posts.

The blog is a way to force myself to write more. Writing is structured thinking, so through writing, I am developing my thoughts and giving them more depth and consistency. 

The huge plus is that it’s very fun to share my thoughts and photos.

## About me

When I was growing up, my dad would always bring home gadgets and I loved playing with them.

Now, I’m studying Industrial Design at the University of Washington. The program is multidisciplinary and I love getting to explore the intersection of Industrial and Interaction Design.

After this, I’ll be out there somewhere making gadgets.

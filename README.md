Hey there,
I’m a designer.

In other words, I try to make complex concepts feel simple.

Currently, I’m designing an interface to manage screens and content at ScreenCloud.

Previously, I studied design at the University of Washington, where I got to work on projects with Microsoft’s Surface/Xbox team and with TEAGUE, a consultancy that designs airplane experiences for Boeing.

After hours, I design git for recipes, write blogs, and record podcasts. I’m always interested in meeting curious and passionate people — let’s grab a coffee.

Thanks for stopping by, <br/>

Hey — I’m a designer living in Bangkok, Thailand. I believe design, done right, can make complex problems feel simple. I strive to do this in my work.

Currently, I’m at ScreenCloud, where I’m designing an interface to manage screens and content.

Previously, I studied design at the University of Washington, where I got to work on projects with Microsoft’s Surface/Xbox team and with TEAGUE, a consultancy that designs airplane experiences for Boeing.

After hours, I design git for recipes, write blogs, and record podcasts. I’m always interested in meeting curious and passionate people — let’s grab a coffee.

Thanks for stopping by, <br/>

I don’t think that’s the case anymore—it’s resolve.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/this/moontray2.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Westworld is Beautiful</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/westworld_is_beautiful/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Westworld is Beautiful" /><published>2018-10-29T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-10-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/westworld_is_beautiful</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/westworld_is_beautiful/">&lt;p&gt;If you have not seen &lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;, you need to see it. The show is incredibly timely. It deals with topics like artificial intelligence and consciousness. It also has great writing and it’s full intricately crafted mysteries. The harder you look at the show, the better it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what we’re here to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When watching the show and scrutinizing every line dialogue to decipher what is happening, it’s easy to forget how beautiful the show is. It’s clear that Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, and their team sweat over every shot, and the resulting product is gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, show don’t tell. So here you go: a masterfully edited video by Alejandro Brun, set to the show’s cover of &lt;em&gt;Runaway&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy it fullscreen, with the audio on.&lt;/p&gt;

Windows would hijack their installer with a warning, proclaiming, “you already have Microsoft Edge – the safer, faster browser for Windows 10.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/edge/warning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows is perplexed and clearly annoyed. Sure, &lt;em&gt;if you must&lt;/em&gt;, you can bypass the warning and install Chrome, but &lt;em&gt;why won’t you just use the safer, faster browser?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bizarre to be sure, but this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/how-to/turn-off-windows-10s-pushy-edge-notifications/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;isn’t the first time Microsoft has tried—aggressively—to get users to use Edge&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, users running Chrome get notifications about the woes of Chrome (it hurts battery life) and wonders of Edge (it’s built for Windows 10, whatever that means).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;w-60-ns&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/edge/notification.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all this begs the question, why does it matter what browser people use? Why is Microsoft forcing Edge on everyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-the-services-company&quot;&gt;Microsoft, the Services Company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Windows and Office were cash cows and they basically ruled the company.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, not so much. Microsoft wanted everyone on Windows 10 so much that they gave it away for free, then extended the free period because people were still using Windows 7, then extended it again. As for Office, it’s all subscription-based now, and unless you work in a company that buys into the Microsoft ecosystem, you’re probably not using Office, you use Google Docs instead. So Microsoft just wants to get everyone to use their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this related to Edge? According to Microsofters (Microsofties?) I talked to, the company’s internal metrics show that people who use Edge use more Microsoft services (OneDrive, Office, Outlook, etc). This means that to get more people on Office 365, Microsoft has to get them to browse the web with Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;correlation-and-causation&quot;&gt;Correlation and Causation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In statistics, people throw around the phrase “correlation does not imply causation” a lot and it’s very useful. For example, ice cream sales and the rate of drowning deaths seem to have a direct relationship. As ice cream sales go up, more people drown.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:n&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:n&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This would imply that ice cream causes people to drown, but obviously, that’s not the case. But for other contexts, say, an increase in Edge usage and more adoption of Microsoft services, that can be harder to ascertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen Microsoft’s internal metrics, so this next part is pure speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does Edge really increase adoption of Microsoft services? I struggle to see the direct line between someone using Edge and someone buying an Office subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that there is no direct causation — one does not cause the other. Rather, people who use Edge are less-savvy users who stick to the defaults and services recommended to them (in this case, Microsoft services). This means that these people aren’t using these services because of Edge, but because they use whatever Windows tells them to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, does repeatedly pestering Chrome and Firefox users to switch to Edge result in more Office subscriptions? Probably not. These users are more savvy and make their own decisions on which services to use, so blindly pushing Edge on users is most likely not productive. Probably unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Windows and Office teams used to fight &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. If you ever meet an older MSFT employee at a party, ask them for Windows vs Office stories. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:n&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I’m part of the graduating class and I think we’ve put together an incredible show. We are showcasing critical, interesting, and wide-ranging work. There’s some great convention stuff, along with some more conceptual and vulnerable work on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should come take a look. I think you’ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Japanese, Naoto is much more. He promotes design education and is a fixture in the Japanese scene. Naoto, together with fashion designer, Issey Miyaki, and graphic designer, Taku Satoh, founded the 21_21 DESIGN SIGHT museum, where they direct and curate each exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21_21 DESIGN SIGHT has rotating exhibits and I got a chance to see the “GRAND PROJECTS: HOW FAR WILL YOU GO?” exhibit. Grand Projects feature large-scale projects (hence the name “grand”) that inspire a sense of awe and wonder (“how far will you go?”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects are interesting because they strike the perfect balance between conceptual art and purposeful design. Through these works, we can explore how much more delightful and inspiring our daily lives can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An installation of glass wall, segmented into parts and filled with comfortable bedding and entertainment. There was even an overnight event where people could stay over, while people on the outside could watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s totally weird and voyeuristic, but having been inside, it’s oddly comfortable. There’s something with the soft sheets and the beautiful natural light and courtyard. It should be very uncomfortable but it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plastic cocoon made out of clear tape. It’s a resilient structure with a very interesting form. The cocoon flexes when people walk around inside, but it is secured with very strong metal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is an experience in itself. While lining up, you can hear voices and sounds of the people inside, but you have no idea what it’s like in there or what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a mystery, and when you finally get to climb inside, it’s exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other design museums in Tokyo, but 21_21 stands out as the most interesting one. Other museums, like the Nezu Museum, boasts design work, but in reality are filled with historic paintings and artifacts, not design work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 21_21 is definitely worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nirawit Jittipairoj</name></author><summary type="html">To the Western world, Naoto Fukasawa is known as the designer behind many iconic Muji products.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/design_sight/hero.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Seattle Mini Maker Faire</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/seattle_mini_maker_faire/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seattle Mini Maker Faire" /><published>2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/seattle_mini_maker_faire</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/seattle_mini_maker_faire/">&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, some government somewhere bombastically declares that they’ll be creating the next Silicon Valley, along with announcing some kind of one-time investment (yeah, it’s going to take more commitment than that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not how it works. It takes culture, education, talent, and time. You can’t just dump money at a borough in some city somewhere. That’s why Silicon Valley cannot be replicated, at least not that easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because this thought kept flowing through my head as I walked through the Maker Faire. A lot of the attendees were not middle-aged nerds, they were children and their eyes were full of wonder. These kids are going to grow up surrounded by cool tech, surrounded by opportunities to learn about them, and be awed at the possibilities. They are going to grow up to make some groundbreaking stuff one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, this is how you make Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yasukuni Shrine commemorates soldiers who fought and lost their lives in service of Japan. It is also where their souls are enshrined, resting peacefully for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, the United States imposed the separation of church and state onto Japan. The shrine, previously ran by the government, had to become secular or break off into a private institution. The government chose the latter, and since then, the shrine has been owned and operated by a ultra right-wing nationalist group. The shrine is now also home to a revisionist history museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 70s, priests secretly enshrined the souls of a thousand war criminals, including those directly responsible for planning and ordering atrocities in WWII. Enshrinement effectively erased their sins and their souls are now honored alongside other servicemen and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Yasukuni Shrine has since been mired in controversy. Japan is a pacifist country now, with its constitution outlawing war and a proper military.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As such, many Japanese oppose the enshrinement, seeing it as a step backwards to Japan’s imperialist past. Asian countries, having been victims of Japan’s war crimes, see the shrine as a celebration of Japan’s actions in the war and a lack of remorse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and his ruling party will visit the shrine as a way to please their nationalist and yakuza friends. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/15/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-cabinet-steer-clear-war-linked-yasukuni-shrine-anniversary-world-war-ii-surrender/&quot;&gt;On this anniversary day, Abe sent members of his cabinet there on his behalf&lt;/a&gt; to avoid souring relations with China and South Korea, as he sought to work with them on the North Korean issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anniversary is a special day that draws many visitors. As such, the number of political activists has also increased. They lined the streets from the subway exit all the way to the shrine’s entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03753.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03754.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some were anti-China, some were pro-Taiwan, and others were advocating for domestic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03751.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of the Yasukuni entrance, someone had started a poll asking whether there will be a crisis with North Korea, whether Japan should expand the powers of its military, and whether Japan should possess the ability to conduct pre-emptive strikes. As you can see, the answers are overwhelmingly yes, but there’s probably some sample bias in asking this crowd as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03757.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Right behind the entrance lies a statue of Ōmura Masujirō, the father of the modern Japanese military.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was quite a bit of police presence as there was an event of some sort happening that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03756.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a gathering of nationalists hanging out, talking, and singing nationalist and war songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I found surprising was how many Self-Defense Force personnel openly associated with right-wing nationalist groups. These groups insist on a revisionist version of history where Japan never started the war and never committed war crimes. They also advocate for a much more expansive military, directly at odds with the mission of the Self-Defense Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A grandma asks a teenager, dressed in an Imperial Japan uniform, to take a photo with her grandson (not pictured).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, it started raining apocalyptically and I had to take shelter in the cafeteria, which also doubled as a souvenir shop. Many Yakuza factions, aligned with nationalist groups, came to Yasukuni that day. We were trapped in the cafeteria together for almost two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03826.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yakuza operates largely in the open. They have offices that politicians visit, they own companies, operate whole neighborhoods, and they are in every part of Japanese society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03827.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing all that, I still found it surprising that everyone was just nonchalantly mingling with them. In fact, I think one of them made some room for me as I tried to find a spot to eat some yakisoba (the cafeteria sold overpriced food and beer).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:n&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:n&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03831.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03834.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03843.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03835.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cafeteria also had some pro-Abe posters. Amusingly, their Abe illustration of Abe made him look funny. Shouldn’t this kind of thing make him look flattering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03840.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rain slowed from a storm to a constant drizzle, I decided to go line up to see the actual shrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03848.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Filming is prohibited inside the grounds. Here, we see a television cameraman filming. I’m guessing he got special permission.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were hundreds of people in line, and they were there even  before the storm subsided. These are not old people who are products of the past, they are part of the younger generation who still fully subscribe to Japan’s pre-war philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03854.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03868.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03870.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, many Asian countries are turning away from democracy and human rights to embrace more authoritarian regimes. In countries like the Philippines and Thailand, the masses went to the polls to vote their own rights away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, Shinzō Abe is winning the fight to change Japan’s post-war pacifist constitution. This would lift restrictions on Japan’s military and would be a huge step backwards into the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is old is new again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;black-60&quot;&gt;Photos taken on August 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most are from the area, some fly in, and everyone brings their keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside, there are dozens of tables where people display their keyboards alongside placards detailing the model, switch, keycaps, and other modifications. From there, people walk around and mingle, nerding out about keyboards, typing on them, and just having a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanical keyboard community is one of the kindest and most helpful communities on the internet. There are many meetups around the world, and attending them provides an opportunity to meet people IRL and put their faces to their online names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind each keyboard is a story; how it was built, what all the parts are, and why the person built it. I went around talking to awesome people and took their portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Someone modded two keyboards with really heavy keys (160g and 280g) for people to test their typing speeds on. 160g was quite heavy, 280g was ridiculous.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Artisan/novel keycaps are unique. Unlike regular keys which represent letters or symbols, artisans are color heads, faces, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/vm7Y2&quot;&gt;ramen&lt;/a&gt;. They are quite expensive and can be one-of-a-kind. At the event, some people were selling and trading their artisans.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/a4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There was also an artisan keycap making area, where attendees carved some kind of soft brown rubber.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/solder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There were soldering and handwiring workshops as well. This is a necessary skill for building a keyboard from scratch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Jack Humbert, the owner of OLKB, went around the meetup via telepresence robot.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/tele2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My favorite photo I took at the meetup. There’s a comical seriousness to someone holding up a keyboard to show a robot.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/trivia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There was a trivia for prizes. It was very fun and was quite casual. Not the nasty competitive kind.
&lt;br /&gt;I teamed up with a random stranger, and somehow we got 6/10, through some lucky guesses and random facts we knew. This turned out to a high enough score and we got artisan-shaped chocolate.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first meetup and I’m quite new and ignorant about keyboards. Nonetheless, people were always willing to answer questions. The community is awesome, and I had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years is a great time to reflect on the state of Soylent—the company and the mission, as well as what Soylent has been like for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-soylent-dream&quot;&gt;The Soylent Dream&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I fell in love with Soylent, I fell in love with &lt;em&gt;the idea of Soylent&lt;/em&gt;. The idea that we have the understanding and the technology to create the perfect food for ourselves. Food that is nutritionally perfect (most of what we eat are not). Food that is efficient—efficient to manufacture and efficient to transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of shipping around perishable solids, we can ship powder. Then, by just adding clean water, people can make the nutritionally perfect meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-away-from-powder&quot;&gt;Moving Away from Powder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob Rhinehart, who created Soylent and championed the idea of Powder, now stocks dozens of bottles of Soylent in his home and drinks them full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of shipping liquids around the country is ridiculously inefficient. In fact, it’s antithetical to the Soylent Dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, that Dream has been put on hold. The company’s focus is now on snacking, which is where the consumer demand and the profits are. I don’t blame them. After all, Soylent is a profit-seeking company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means Powder is now neglected, while Drinks are constantly being improved upon. My last Powder experience was version 1.5, which tasted disgusting and sometimes caused indigestion. It was bad, and like Rhinehart, I’ve moved away from Powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-daily-experience&quot;&gt;The Daily Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I last &lt;a href=&quot;http://steakscience.com/drinking-the-future/&quot;&gt;wrote about Soylent&lt;/a&gt;, I had a very positive experience. That is still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent fits perfectly into my daily life. I’m going to university and I also have a job. That means I’m either at work or in class. With Soylent, I can have lunch anywhere without disrupting whatever task I’m doing at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends and co-workers often see me with Soylent and I usually get asked the same questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it taste like? Does it taste good? Do you actually get full? Why don’t you like real food?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are great questions, and I’ll answer them here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-it-taste-like-does-it-taste-good&quot;&gt;What does it taste like? Does it taste good?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My go-to answer for is that Soylent tastes like cereal milk, but thicker in texture and not sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it taste good? It’s difficult to answer this one, not just because taste is subjective, but because Soylent isn’t meant to be savored or tasted. Soylent is supposed to be a neutral sustenance; one that you can drink every day without tiring. It tastes pretty neutral and I don’t actively think about the taste when I drink. I just drink. Like how I drink water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-actually-get-full&quot;&gt;Do you actually get full?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent doesn’t actually get me full. Instead, it gets me to this in-between state, which is even better. When you think about it, getting full isn’t a good thing. It’s your body saying, “don’t even try to shove more food in here.” Getting to that point means you’ve already eaten more than you should’ve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-between state I’m speaking of is different. It’s the perfect balance between being hungry and full. There’s no urge to consume anymore, nor is there any fatigue or discomfort from consuming too much. Just perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the direct answer. The average person needs 2000 calories per day. A single Soylent drink has 400 calories, so I drink five a day. Of course, some people need more, and others less. You can experiment and find the right amount for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-dont-you-like-real-food&quot;&gt;Why don’t you like real food?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha. I do like real food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most food I have access to is bad—unhealthy, tastes bad, time-consuming to eat, and expensive. I never say Soylent is for everyone, but it is perfect for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nirawit Jittipairoj</name></author><summary type="html">For the past three years, I’ve replaced most of my meals with Soylent.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/images/soylent_3/hero.jpg" /></entry></feed>

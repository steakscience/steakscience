&lt;p&gt;This year, I’m part of the graduating class and I think we’ve put together an incredible show. We are showcasing critical, interesting, and wide-ranging work. There’s some great convention stuff, along with some more conceptual and vulnerable work on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should come take a look. I think you’ll like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Japanese, Naoto is much more. He promotes design education and is a fixture in the Japanese scene. Naoto, together with fashion designer, Issey Miyaki, and graphic designer, Taku Satoh, founded the 21_21 DESIGN SIGHT museum, where they direct and curate each exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21_21 DESIGN SIGHT has rotating exhibits and I got a chance to see the “GRAND PROJECTS: HOW FAR WILL YOU GO?” exhibit. Grand Projects feature large-scale projects (hence the name “grand”) that inspire a sense of awe and wonder (“how far will you go?”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects are interesting because they strike the perfect balance between conceptual art and purposeful design. Through these works, we can explore how much more delightful and inspiring our daily lives can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An installation of glass wall, segmented into parts and filled with comfortable bedding and entertainment. There was even an overnight event where people could stay over, while people on the outside could watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s totally weird and voyeuristic, but having been inside, it’s oddly comfortable. There’s something with the soft sheets and the beautiful natural light and courtyard. It should be very uncomfortable but it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plastic cocoon made out of clear tape. It’s a resilient structure with a very interesting form. The cocoon flexes when people walk around inside, but it is secured with very strong metal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is an experience in itself. While lining up, you can hear voices and sounds of the people inside, but you have no idea what it’s like in there or what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a mystery, and when you finally get to climb inside, it’s exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other design museums in Tokyo, but 21_21 stands out as the most interesting one. Other museums, like the Nezu Museum, boasts design work, but in reality are filled with historic paintings and artifacts, not design work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 21_21 is definitely worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nirawit Jittipairoj</name></author><summary type="html">To the Western world, Naoto Fukasawa is known as the designer behind many iconic Muji products.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://steakscience.com/images/design_sight/hero.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Seattle Mini Maker Faire</title><link href="http://steakscience.com/seattle_mini_maker_faire/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seattle Mini Maker Faire" /><published>2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://steakscience.com/seattle_mini_maker_faire</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://steakscience.com/seattle_mini_maker_faire/">&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, some government somewhere bombastically declares that they’ll be creating the next Silicon Valley, along with announcing some kind of one-time investment (yeah, it’s going to take more commitment than that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not how it works. It takes culture, education, talent, and time. You can’t just dump money at a borough in some city somewhere. That’s why Silicon Valley cannot be replicated, at least not that easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because this thought kept flowing through my head as I walked through the Maker Faire. A lot of the attendees were not middle-aged nerds, they were children and their eyes were full of wonder. These kids are going to grow up surrounded by cool tech, surrounded by opportunities to learn about them, and be awed at the possibilities. They are going to grow up to make some groundbreaking stuff one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, this is how you make Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yasukuni Shrine commemorates soldiers who fought and lost their lives in service of Japan. It is also where their souls are enshrined, resting peacefully for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, the United States imposed the separation of church and state onto Japan. The shrine, previously ran by the government, had to become secular or break off into a private institution. The government chose the latter, and since then, the shrine has been owned and operated by a ultra right-wing nationalist group. The shrine is now also home to a revisionist history museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 70s, priests secretly enshrined the souls of a thousand war criminals, including those directly responsible for planning and ordering atrocities in WWII. Enshrinement effectively erased their sins and their souls are now honored alongside other servicemen and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Yasukuni Shrine has since been mired in controversy. Japan is a pacifist country now, with its constitution outlawing war and a proper military&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As such, many Japanese oppose the enshrinement, seeing it as a step backwards to Japan’s imperialist past. Asian countries, having been victims of Japan’s war crimes, see the shrine as a celebration of Japan’s actions in the war and a lack of remorse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and his ruling party will visit the shrine as a way to please their nationalist and yakuza friends. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/15/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-cabinet-steer-clear-war-linked-yasukuni-shrine-anniversary-world-war-ii-surrender/&quot;&gt;On this anniversary day, Abe sent members of his cabinet there on his behalf&lt;/a&gt; to avoid souring relations with China and South Korea, as he sought to work with them on the North Korean issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anniversary is a special day that draws many visitors. As such, the number of political activists has also increased. They lined the streets from the subway exit all the way to the shrine’s entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03753.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03754.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some were anti-China, some were pro-Taiwan, and others were advocating for domestic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03751.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of the Yasukuni entrance, someone had started a poll asking whether there will be a crisis with North Korea, whether Japan should expand the powers of its military, and whether Japan should possess the ability to conduct pre-emptive strikes. As you can see, the answers are overwhelmingly yes, but there’s probably some sample bias in asking this crowd as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03757.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Right behind the entrance lies a statue of Ōmura Masujirō, the father of the modern Japanese military.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was quite a bit of police presence as there was an event of some sort happening that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03756.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03773.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03846.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03779.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03789.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a gathering of nationalists hanging out, talking, and singing nationalist and war songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I found surprising was how many Self-Defense Force personnel openly associated with right-wing nationalist groups. These groups insist on a revisionist version of history where Japan never started the war and never committed war crimes. They also advocate for a much more expansive military, directly at odds with the mission of the Self-Defense Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;A grandma asks a teenager, dressed in an Imperial Japan uniform, to take a photo with her grandson (not pictured).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, it started raining apocalyptically and I had to take shelter in the cafeteria, which also doubled as a souvenir shop. Many Yakuza factions, aligned with nationalist groups, came to Yasukuni that day. We were trapped in the cafeteria together for almost two hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03826.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yakuza operates largely in the open. They have offices that politicians visit, they own companies, operate whole neighborhoods, and they are in every part of Japanese society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03827.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing all that, I still found it surprising that everyone was just nonchalantly mingling with them. In fact, I think one of them made some room for me as I tried to find a spot to eat some yakisoba&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:n&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:n&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (the cafeteria sold overpriced food and beer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03831.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03834.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03843.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03835.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cafeteria also had some pro-Abe posters. Amusingly, their Abe illustration of Abe made him look funny. Shouldn’t this kind of thing make him look flattering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03840.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rain slowed from a storm to a constant drizzle, I decided to go line up to see the actual shrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03848.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Filming is prohibited inside the grounds. Here, we see a television cameraman filming. I’m guessing he got special permission.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were hundreds of people in line, and they were there even  before the storm subsided. These are not old people who are products of the past, they are part of the younger generation who still fully subscribe to Japan’s pre-war philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03854.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03868.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/yasukuni/DSC03870.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, many Asian countries are turning away from democracy and human rights to embrace more authoritarian regimes. In countries like the Philippines and Thailand, the masses went to the polls to vote their own rights away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Japan, Shinzō Abe is winning the fight to change Japan’s post-war pacifist constitution. This would lift restrictions on Japan’s military and would be a huge step backwards into the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is old is new again.&lt;/p&gt;

Most are from the area, some fly in, and everyone brings their keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside, there are dozens of tables where people display their keyboards alongside placards detailing the model, switch, keycaps, and other modifications. From there, people walk around and mingle, nerding out about keyboards, typing on them, and just having a great time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanical keyboard community is one of the kindest and most helpful communities on the internet. There are many meetups around the world, and attending them provides an opportunity to meet people IRL and put their faces to their online names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind each keyboard is a story; how it was built, what all the parts are, and why the person built it. I went around talking to awesome people and took their portraits.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Someone modded two keyboards with really heavy keys (160g and 280g) for people to test their typing speeds on. 160g was quite heavy, 280g was ridiculous.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/a1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Artisan/novel keycaps are unique. Unlike regular keys which represent letters or symbols, artisans are color heads, faces, or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/gallery/vm7Y2&quot;&gt;ramen&lt;/a&gt;. They are quite expensive and can be one-of-a-kind. At the event, some people were selling and trading their artisans.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/a2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/a4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There was also an artisan keycap making area, where attendees carved some kind of soft brown rubber.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/solder.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There were soldering and handwiring workshops as well. This is a necessary skill for building a keyboard from scratch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/tele2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;My favorite photo I took at the meetup. There’s a comical seriousness to someone holding up a keyboard to show a robot.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;leftCaption&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/smk/trivia.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;There was a trivia for prizes. It was very fun and was quite casual. Not the nasty competitive kind.
&lt;br /&gt;I teamed up with a random stranger, and somehow we got 6/10, through some lucky guesses and random facts we knew. This turned out to a high enough score and we got artisan-shaped chocolate.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first meetup and I’m quite new and ignorant about keyboards. Nonetheless, people were always willing to answer questions. The community is awesome, and I had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years is a great time to reflect on the state of Soylent—the company and the mission, as well as what Soylent has been like for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-soylent-dream&quot;&gt;The Soylent Dream&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I fell in love with Soylent, I fell in love with &lt;em&gt;the idea of Soylent&lt;/em&gt;. The idea that we have the understanding and the technology to create the perfect food for ourselves. Food that is nutritionally perfect (most of what we eat are not). Food that is efficient—efficient to manufacture and efficient to transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of shipping around perishable solids, we can ship powder. Then, by just adding clean water, people can make the nutritionally perfect meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moving-away-from-powder&quot;&gt;Moving Away from Powder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob Rhinehart, who created Soylent and championed the idea of Powder, now stocks dozens of bottles of Soylent in his home and drinks them full-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of shipping liquids around the country is ridiculously inefficient. In fact, it’s antithetical to the Soylent Dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, that Dream has been put on hold. The company’s focus is now on snacking, which is where the consumer demand and the profits are. I don’t blame them. After all, Soylent is a profit-seeking company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means Powder is now neglected, while Drinks are constantly being improved upon. My last Powder experience was version 1.5, which tasted disgusting and sometimes caused indigestion. It was bad, and like Rhinehart, I’ve moved away from Powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-daily-experience&quot;&gt;The Daily Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I last &lt;a href=&quot;http://steakscience.com/drinking-the-future/&quot;&gt;wrote about Soylent&lt;/a&gt;, I had a very positive experience. That is still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent fits perfectly into my daily life. I’m going to university and I also have a job. That means I’m either at work or in class. With Soylent, I can have lunch anywhere without disrupting whatever task I’m doing at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends and co-workers often see me with Soylent and I usually get asked the same questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it taste like? Does it taste good? Do you actually get full? Why don’t you like real food?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are great questions, and I’ll answer them here as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-it-taste-like-does-it-taste-good&quot;&gt;What does it taste like? Does it taste good?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My go-to answer for is that Soylent tastes like cereal milk, but thicker in texture and not sweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it taste good? It’s difficult to answer this one, not just because taste is subjective, but because Soylent isn’t meant to be savored or tasted. Soylent is supposed to be a neutral sustenance; one that you can drink every day without tiring. It tastes pretty neutral and I don’t actively think about the taste when I drink. I just drink. Like how I drink water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-you-actually-get-full&quot;&gt;Do you actually get full?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent doesn’t actually get me full. Instead, it gets me to this in-between state, which is even better. When you think about it, getting full isn’t a good thing. It’s your body saying, “don’t even try to shove more food in here.” Getting to that point means you’ve already eaten more than you should’ve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-between state I’m speaking of is different. It’s the perfect balance between being hungry and full. There’s no urge to consume anymore, nor is there any fatigue or discomfort from consuming too much. Just perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the direct answer. The average person needs 2000 calories per day. A single Soylent drink has 400 calories, so I drink five a day. Of course, some people need more, and others less. You can experiment and find the right amount for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-dont-you-like-real-food&quot;&gt;Why don’t you like real food?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha. I do like real food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most food I have access to is bad—unhealthy, tastes bad, time-consuming to eat, and expensive. I never say Soylent is for everyone, but it is perfect for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nirawit Jittipairoj</name></author><summary type="html">For the past three years, I’ve replaced most of my meals with Soylent.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://steakscience.com/images/soylent_3/hero.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Iconic iPhone</title><link href="http://steakscience.com/the-iconic-iphone/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Iconic iPhone" /><published>2017-09-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://steakscience.com/the-iconic-iphone</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://steakscience.com/the-iconic-iphone/">&lt;p&gt;With any Apple-related topic, there are no shortage of opinions. Most of them are rushed, sensationalistic, and not worth anyone’s time—they’re just there to attract pageviews and boost ad revenue. Then there’s the small segment of thoughtful and nuanced pieces that are actually worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, with this flood of opinion, you can be sure the “correct take” is hidden in there somewhere. However, with the iPhone X notch, that doesn’t seem to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s my take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two common arguments against the notch. The first is that the notch is awkward in software. It stands out in iOS’s all-white interface. And it’s there, awkwardly lurking, in landscape when you watch videos and when you browse the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;iPhone X renders webpages with literal white bars on the sides &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ztcWetrLPo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ztcWetrLPo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Thomas &amp;quot;Kick Nazis out, @jack&amp;quot; Fuchs (@thomasfuchs) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/907764896829452288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 13, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, the people complaining aren’t using the actual device, they are watching screen recordings from emulators. One thing with we learned from the Essential Phone, which also has a notch, is that users stop seeing it within hours. It’s just like how people with glasses don’t see their glasses frames. The notch being an annoying eyesore is not an actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say the software treatment of the notch is perfect. There are many rough edges and some things are downright inelegant (like landscape web browsing), but it’s important to remember that Apple has total control of the iOS interface. They’re already changing things, and the interface is only going to get better from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other argument is that the notch is ugly. Why not just cover up the sides and hide it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Apps that embrace the notch on the new iPhone X look bad. Look better with a black background for the status bar. Quick comparison &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/iphonex?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#iphonex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3o4bJQC4NB&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/3o4bJQC4NB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Carlos Gavina (@carlosgavina) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/carlosgavina/status/907687992764125185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 12, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ugly argument is hard to rebut because aesthetics is subjective. Personally, I think the notch is beautiful and the notch serves a strategic purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone has always been iconic. Ask anyone to draw an iPhone and they’ll draw a rectangle with a home button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/notch/home.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, ask people to draw an Android phone, and you won’t get a consistent result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/notch/s3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android phones can look like anything, but you know an iPhone when you see one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Samsung’s Galaxy S8 next to LG’s V30 smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/notch/s8_v30.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are nearly identical from the front. Philippe Starck, an industrial designer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16311476/philippe-starck-xiaomi-mi-mix-phone-design&quot;&gt;opined that bezel-less phones mark the end of phone design&lt;/a&gt;. He’s right. There’s a lot less to design now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens when the iPhone’s home button disappears? The iconic iPhone silhouette also disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the other problem of the front-facing camera and FaceID. They still need to be in front and they aren’t ever going away—we will always have front-facing cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you solve these two problems?&lt;/strong&gt; Design is all about compromises and managing tradeoffs. And the notch is definitely a tradeoff. It’s there because we need space for cameras and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: the notch solves the all-bezel-less-phones-look-the-same problem. &lt;strong&gt;They’ve created the new iconic iPhone silhouette&lt;/strong&gt;. Apple has managed to turn an undesirable tradeoff into an elegant solution. That’s incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a few years from now when you ask a stranger to draw an iPhone, they won’t be drawing this, or this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/notch/not.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll be drawing this:&lt;/p&gt;

Unbeknownst to him, he started a revolution and his life, along with many others, would never be the same again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I hypothesized that the body doesn’t need food itself, merely the chemicals and elements it contains. So, I resolved to embark on an experiment. What if I consumed only the raw ingredients the body uses for energy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His blog exploded in popularity. As it turned out, many people were intrigued by the idea of not eating food. Almost as many wanted to try it out. So Rhinehart came up with the first prototype of what he called “Soylent” and enlisted many enthusiasts in his the trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many have aspired to create a meal-replacement drink for decades, none have been this well-executed and well-thought-out. To take Soylent to its next step, Rhinehart started a crowdfunding campaign. In the end, Soylent raked in over one million dollars, exponentially exceeding its target goal of 100 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a species, we have done a great job—we colonized the earth and we eternally established ourselves on the very top of the food chain. However, as the most intelligent inhabitants of this planet, we have failed miserably. We have trashed the Earth and our way of life is not only unsustainable, it is grossly wasteful. Meat is especially inefficient—one kilogram of beef requires 30 kilograms of grain to make, not to mention the unspeakable atrocities we have to subject our animals to just to feed ourselves. According to projections, we will need to double our food production to feed ourselves in 40 years. Doubling our production would mean much more cruelty and waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;, when asked about the survival of the human species, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) says, “We’ll find a way, we always have.” Soylent is incredibly efficient, humane, and easy to store and transport. Maybe this is it. Maybe Soylent is going to solve our food crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/soylent/soylent-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been fascinated by technology and how it will impact our future. When I heard about Soylent, I knew I had to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soylent is a living product, it is constantly being updated and even comes with a changelog. Currently, it is at version 1.4, which is the version I tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Soylent is easy, especially if you want to make one bag at a time, which is what I did. All I had to do was dump the whole bag into a pitcher, fill it water, and shake for a minute. Others blend it to achieve perfect consistency, but I find that leaving it overnight in the fridge works just as well. A bag is good for 3–4 meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first glass is always the hardest. It was very strange to replace a whole meal with just a glass of light brown liquid which tasted foreign. Others have compared the taste to pancake batter, to me, it tasted like a nuttier version of almond milk. The consensus is that Soylent gets much better after the first glass, so I suggest you ease your way in by mixing in some vanilla extract, which makes Soylent quite delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drink Soylent 2–3 times a day, usually replacing my breakfast and lunch. Unlike real food, Soylent fills me up instantly. I assume this is related to its aqueous nature. The greatest strength of Soylent however, is that it saves large amounts of time. I can finish a whole meal within 3 minutes and I can multitask while doing so. I cannot stress the importance of this. There are days when I spend hours in the computer lab. Instead of having to waste upwards of 30 minutes on food, I can just drink, focus on my work, and never have to leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other benefit is that every meal has just the right amount of nutrition and energy. Living on campus food has been disastrous in this regard. I can either get overpriced salad and know they I’ll be hungry by 4 PM, or get some processed protein submerged in gravy that ensures that I’m tired and sleepy for the rest of the day. As you can see, the meals are woefully unbalanced and I’m facing undesirable consequences either way. With Soylent however, my energy level is just right. I’m never hungry or full, but rather, I’m in this in-between state that is perfect for getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/soylent/soylent-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are some drawbacks to Soylent. The first that everyone always mentions is that food is not just sustenance, it is also a social activity. That is true, but the reality is, a lot of the time people eat their meals alone, in which case, Soylent would be great. I don’t completely dismiss real food. Cooking is an art form and there many experiences exclusive to dining. This is where I think Soylent marketing has it wrong—they should promote replacing quick and solitary meals with Soylent, not promote going full-time Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some small annoyances with consuming a mostly liquid diet. Some people have experienced some problems with their jaw because they don’t chew enough, but this has not been an issue with myself or others I’ve talked to. Also, drinking Soylent psychologically decreases the urge to drink water, which can become problematic in the summer. I have definitely experienced dehydration. The last annoyance I can come up with is that Soylent contains a lot of grains, which makes me quite gassy. I fart more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/soylent/soylent-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, Soylent is not bad at all. After drinking it for several weeks, I found myself craving it over a regular meal. Living near campus, I’m surrounded by unhealthy factory-prepared food that don’t even taste good. With that in mind, going Soylent is a no-brainer decision. It’s signficantly healthier and I never feel bloated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, no one really knows whether a drink will replace food for future generations. But as long as &lt;a href=&quot;http://mosaicscience.com/story/eating-insects&quot;&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; are the alternative, I’ll be perfectly happy with Soylent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nirawit Jittipairoj</name></author><summary type="html">One afternoon in February 2013, Rob Rhinehart published a blog post about how he stopped eating food.

&lt;p&gt;There really isn’t anyone else pursuing something like they are: one operating system across all devices: desktops, tablets, laptops, phones, and TVs (Xbox). It’s wild, it’s crazy, and it’s the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Windows has always been held back by bad hardware. PC manufacturers don’t invest enough care and consideration into their products. Instead, making PCs has always been about cutting corners. In their race to the bottom, manufacturers succumb to using the worst of materials, preinstalling bloatware (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8067505/lenovo-installs-adware-private-data-hackers&quot;&gt;sometimes spyware&lt;/a&gt;), and using cheap hardware that guarantees a frustrating experience. When attempting to compete on the high-end, manufacturers suffer from their lack of expertise with premium materials, driving up prices. As a result, the first generation of aluminum Ultrabooks ended up being more expensive than the MacBook Air, which they were supposed to undercut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/redmond/microsoft_retail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has always been a deal-breaker with every PC; an “all-day” battery that lasts only 3 hours, an unusable trackpad, or unbearable build quality. Using Windows meant having to choose the device with most tolerable flaw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Microsoft tried to fix the bloatware problem by introducing &lt;em&gt;Signature&lt;/em&gt;, a line of computers with the bloatware removed. However, this fixed only half of the problem—no software can make up for ugly displays and wobbly plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many, the solution was obvious: Microsoft should just make hardware! But the reason they couldn’t was also obvious: Microsoft was a software vendor and had to ensure a level playing field for manufacturers and making their own computer would disrupt that balance. However, everything changed with Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new operating system represented Microsoft’s bold vision for the future. Steven Sinofsky, President of Windows at the time, worried that manufacturers wouldn’t be able to make hardware worthy of showcasing the operating system. Windows 8 deserved something better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;src&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/redmond/surface_covers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surface is the physical manifestation of Windows. It is the culmination of the best parts of Microsoft. It leverages Microsoft Research’s bleeding edge technology and all of Microsoft’s design and engineering prowess. Surface is the computer Windows deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;src&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/redmond/surface-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer of the future is not the iPad nor is it the new MacBook. The iPad excels at content consumption, but to do serious work, you’ll have to resort to a clumsy keyboard case. The new MacBook is the inverse—it is productive, but its keyboard is always there, whether you need it or not. Surface on the other hand, can seamlessly transform from a laptop to a tablet. It will change personal computing forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology has always been about looking to the future and getting excited about the possibilities. To me, Surface is the embodiment of that spirit, and one I can’t stop getting excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I took a pilgrimage to the Mothership yesterday. It’s quite a shame that despite living in Seattle since September, I haven’t been to Redmond yet.&lt;/p&gt;

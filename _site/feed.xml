And that’s the whole conundrum with any Wes Anderson movie, whether it’s Grand Budapest Hotel or Isle of Dogs. They’re not very good; the plot and dialogue are bad and at best mediocre. And yet, they have this unique charm. Every shot is beautiful and you just know that everything—every aspect—was meticulously crafted by a visionary. So, here’s how I would evangelize the film: don’t watch it for the plot. Watch it for the puppets, the sets, and the music. Then just be amazed at the possibilities of human creativity. It’s really good, I promise. Isle of Dogs Animation Featurette #watch There’s always an easy way to do something, and then there’s the hard way. Wes Anderson wanted to make this movie the hard way. Everything had to made physically: each puppet had individual hair strands and replaceable mouths to convincingly portray speech. The explosions were filmed frame by frame as artists manipulated cotton. As a result, the movie took years to make. Of course, Wes could’ve taken the easier route. He could just digitally animate everything. But then, the movie would lose its visceral quality, and that’s something that’s very hard to describe with words. The movie feels real and emotive in a way that grips the audience so I’m glad he did the hard way. Designing Isle of Dogs #read As a designer, the graphic design of the movie really stood out to me. There’s typography everywhere, whether it’s the stylish credits or within the movie itself, on posters, can labels, and store signage. It turns out the movie employed quite a few incredible designers. One of them is Erica Dorn and she has opened up about the design process for the movie.

Windows would hijack their installer with a warning, proclaiming, “you already have Microsoft Edge – the safer, faster browser for Windows 10.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/edge/warning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows is perplexed and clearly annoyed. Sure, &lt;em&gt;if you must&lt;/em&gt;, you can bypass the warning and install Chrome, but &lt;em&gt;why won’t you just use the safer, faster browser?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is bizarre to be sure, but this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/how-to/turn-off-windows-10s-pushy-edge-notifications/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;isn’t the first time Microsoft has tried—aggressively—to get users to use Edge&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, users running Chrome get notifications about the woes of Chrome (it hurts battery life) and wonders of Edge (it’s built for Windows 10, whatever that means).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;w-60-ns&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/edge/notification.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all this begs the question, why does it matter what browser people use? Why is Microsoft forcing Edge on everyone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microsoft-the-services-company&quot;&gt;Microsoft, the Services Company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, Windows and Office were cash cows and they basically ruled the company.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, not so much. Microsoft wanted everyone on Windows 10 so much that they gave it away for free, then extended the free period because people were still using Windows 7, then extended it again. As for Office, it’s all subscription-based now, and unless you work in a company that buys into the Microsoft ecosystem, you’re probably not using Office, you use Google Docs instead. So Microsoft just wants to get everyone to use their services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this related to Edge? According to Microsofters (Microsofties?) I talked to, the company’s internal metrics show that people who use Edge use more Microsoft services (OneDrive, Office, Outlook, etc). This means that to get more people on Office 365, Microsoft has to get them to browse the web with Edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;correlation-and-causation&quot;&gt;Correlation and Causation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In statistics, people throw around the phrase “correlation does not imply causation” a lot and it’s very useful. For example, ice cream sales and the rate of drowning deaths seem to have a direct relationship. As ice cream sales go up, more people drown.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:n&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:n&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This would imply that ice cream causes people to drown, but obviously, that’s not the case. But for other contexts, say, an increase in Edge usage and more adoption of Microsoft services, that can be harder to ascertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t seen Microsoft’s internal metrics, so this next part is pure speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does Edge really increase adoption of Microsoft services? I struggle to see the direct line between someone using Edge and someone buying an Office subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that there is no direct causation—one does not cause the other. Rather, people who use Edge are less-savvy users who stick to the defaults and services recommended to them (in this case, Microsoft services). This means that these people aren’t using these services because of Edge, but because they use whatever Windows tells them to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, does repeatedly pestering Chrome and Firefox users to switch to Edge result in more Office subscriptions? Probably not. These users are more savvy and make their own decisions on which services to use, so blindly pushing Edge on users is most likely not productive. Probably unproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Windows and Office teams used to fight &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. If you ever meet an older MSFT employee at a party, ask them for Windows vs Office stories. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the Japanese, Naoto is much more. He promotes design education and is a fixture in the Japanese scene. Naoto, together with fashion designer, Issey Miyaki, and graphic designer, Taku Satoh, founded the 21_21 DESIGN SIGHT museum, where they direct and curate each exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21_21 DESIGN SIGHT has rotating exhibits and I got a chance to see the “GRAND PROJECTS: HOW FAR WILL YOU GO?” exhibit. Grand Projects feature large-scale projects (hence the name “grand”) that inspire a sense of awe and wonder (“how far will you go?”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These projects are interesting because they strike the perfect balance between conceptual art and purposeful design. Through these works, we can explore how much more delightful and inspiring our daily lives can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An installation of glass wall, segmented into parts and filled with comfortable bedding and entertainment. There was even an overnight event where people could stay over, while people on the outside could watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it’s totally weird and voyeuristic, but having been inside, it’s oddly comfortable. There’s something with the soft sheets and the beautiful natural light and courtyard. It should be very uncomfortable but it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plastic cocoon made out of clear tape. It’s a resilient structure with a very interesting form. The cocoon flexes when people walk around inside, but it is secured with very strong metal parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation is an experience in itself. While lining up, you can hear voices and sounds of the people inside, but you have no idea what it’s like in there or what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/design_sight/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a mystery, and when you finally get to climb inside, it’s exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other design museums in Tokyo, but 21_21 stands out as the most interesting one. Other museums, like the Nezu Museum, boasts design work, but in reality are filled with historic paintings and artifacts, not design work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 21_21 is definitely worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nirawit Jittipairoj</name></author><summary type="html">To the Western world, Naoto Fukasawa is known as the designer behind many iconic Muji products.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://steakscience.com/images/design_sight/hero.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Seattle Mini Maker Faire</title><link href="http://steakscience.com/seattle_mini_maker_faire/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seattle Mini Maker Faire" /><published>2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://steakscience.com/seattle_mini_maker_faire</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://steakscience.com/seattle_mini_maker_faire/">&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, some government somewhere bombastically declares that they’ll be creating the next Silicon Valley, along with announcing some kind of one-time investment (yeah, it’s going to take more commitment than that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not how it works. It takes culture, education, talent, and time. You can’t just dump money at a borough in some city somewhere. That’s why Silicon Valley cannot be replicated, at least not that easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because this thought kept flowing through my head as I walked through the Maker Faire. A lot of the attendees were not middle-aged nerds, they were children and their eyes were full of wonder. These kids are going to grow up surrounded by cool tech, surrounded by opportunities to learn about them, and be awed at the possibilities. They are going to grow up to make some groundbreaking stuff one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, this is how you make Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

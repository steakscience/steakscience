The idea that we have the understanding and the technology to create the perfect food for ourselves. Food that is nutritionally perfect (most of what we eat are not). Food that is efficient — efficient to manufacture and efficient to&nbsp;transport.</p> <p>Instead of shipping around perishable solids, we can ship powder. Then, by just adding clean water, people can make the nutritionally perfect&nbsp;meal.</p> <h2 id="moving-away-from-powder">Moving Away from&nbsp;Powder</h2> <p>Rob Rhinehart, who created Soylent and championed the idea of Powder, now stocks dozens of bottles of Soylent in his home and drinks them&nbsp;full-time.</p> <p>The idea of shipping liquids around the country is ridiculously inefficient. In fact, it’s antithetical to the Soylent&nbsp;Dream.</p> <p>Sadly, that Dream has been put on hold. The company’s focus is now on snacking, which is where the consumer demand and the profits are. I don’t blame them. After all, Soylent is a profit-seeking&nbsp;company.</p> <p>That means Powder is now neglected, while Drinks are constantly being improved upon. My last Powder experience was version <span class="caps">1.5</span>, which tasted disgusting and sometimes caused indigestion. It was bad, and like Rhinehart, I’ve moved away from&nbsp;Powder.</p> <h2 id="the-daily-experience">The Daily&nbsp;Experience</h2> <p>When I last <a href="http://steakscience.com/drinking-the-future/">wrote about Soylent</a>, I had a very positive experience. That is still the&nbsp;same.</p> <p>Soylent fits perfectly into my daily life. I’m going to university and I also have a job. That means I’m either at work or in class. With Soylent, I can have lunch anywhere without disrupting whatever task I’m doing at the&nbsp;time.</p> <hr/> <p>My friends and co-workers often see me with Soylent and I usually get asked the same&nbsp;questions.</p> <p>What does it taste like? Does it taste good? Do you actually get full? Why don’t you like real&nbsp;food?</p> <p>These are great questions, and I’ll answer them here as&nbsp;well.</p> <h2 id="what-does-it-taste-like-does-it-taste-good">What does it taste like? Does it taste&nbsp;good?</h2> <p>My go-to answer for is that Soylent tastes like cereal milk, but thicker in texture and not&nbsp;sweet.</p> <p>Does it taste good? It’s difficult to answer this one, not just because taste is subjective, but because Soylent isn’t meant to be savored or tasted. Soylent is supposed to be a neutral sustenance; one that you can drink every day without tiring. It tastes pretty neutral and I don’t actively think about the taste when I drink. I just drink. Like how I drink&nbsp;water.</p> <h2 id="do-you-actually-get-full">Do you actually get&nbsp;full?</h2> <p>Soylent doesn’t actually get me full. Instead, it gets me to this in-between state, which is even better. When you think about it, getting full isn’t a good thing. It’s your body saying, “don’t even try to shove more food in here.” Getting to that point means you’ve already eaten more than you&nbsp;should’ve.</p> <p>The in-between state I’m speaking of is different. It’s the perfect balance between being hungry and full. There’s no urge to consume anymore, nor is there any fatigue or discomfort from consuming too much. Just&nbsp;perfect.</p> <p>Now for the direct answer. The average person needs 2000 calories per day. A single Soylent drink has 400 calories, so I drink five a day. Of course, some people need more, and others less. You can experiment and find the right amount for&nbsp;you.</p> <h2 id="why-dont-you-like-real-food">Why don’t you like real&nbsp;food?</h2> <p>Ha. I do like real&nbsp;food.</p> <p>Most food I have access to is bad — unhealthy, tastes bad, time-consuming to eat, and expensive. I never say Soylent is for everyone, but it is perfect for&nbsp;me.</p> </section> </article> </div> <footer class="db w-100 ph3-ns ph2-m ph4 cf bg-light-gray"> <div class="db center w-75-ns w-80-m w-100 dia-bold f5-ns f6 lh-solid"> <div class="fl mv3 mr1 tl v-mid"> <a href="/seattle-mechanical-keyboard/" class="link mid-gray hover-dark-gray"> <span class="v-mid">&#60;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seattle Mechanical Keyboard Meetup</span> </a> </div> <div class="fr mv3 ml1 tr v-mid"> <a href="/the-iconic-iphone/" class="link mid-gray hover-dark-gray"> <span class="v-mid">The Iconic iPhone&nbsp;&nbsp;&#62;</span> </a> </div> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>

It is also where their souls are enshrined, resting peacefully for&nbsp;eternity.</p> <p>After World War <span class="caps">II</span>, the United States imposed the separate church and state onto Japan. The shrine, previously ran by the government, had to become secular or break off into a private institution. The government chose the latter, and since then, the shrine has been owned and operated by a ultra right-wing nationalist group. The shrine is now also home to a revisionist history&nbsp;museum.</p> <p>In the 70s, priests secretly enshrined the souls of a thousand war criminals, including those directly responsible for planning and ordering atrocities in <span class="caps">WWII.</span> Enshrinement effectively forgave them of their sins and their souls are now honored alongside other servicemen and&nbsp;women.</p> <p>As a result, Yasukuni Shrine has since been mired in controversy. Japan is a pacifist country now, with its constitution outlawing war and a proper military (Japan has a self-defense force). As such, many Japanese oppose the enshrinement, seeing it as a step backwards to Japan’s imperialist past. Asian countries, having been victims of Japan’s war crimes, see the shrine as a celebration of Japan’s actions in the war and a lack of&nbsp;remorse.</p> <p>Every once in a while, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and his ruling party will visit the shrine as a way to please their nationalist and yakuza friends. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/15/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-cabinet-steer-clear-war-linked-yasukuni-shrine-anniversary-world-war-ii-surrender/">On this anniversary day, Abe sent members of his cabinet there on his behalf</a> to avoid souring relations with China and South Korea, as he sought to work with them on the North Korean&nbsp;issue.</p> <hr/> <p>The anniversary is a special day that draws many visitors. As such, the number of political activists has also increased. They lined the streets from the subway exit all the way to the shrine’s&nbsp;entrance.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03753.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03754.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <p>Some were anti-China, some were pro-Taiwan, and others were advocating for domestic&nbsp;issues.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03751.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <p>In front of the Yasukuni entrance, someone had started a poll asking whether there will be a crisis with North Korea, whether Japan should expand the powers of its military, and whether Japan should possess the ability to perform pre-emptive strikes. As you can see, the answers are overwhelmingly yes, but there’s probably some sample bias in asking this crowd as&nbsp;well.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03757.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <hr/> <figure class="leftCaption"> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03761.jpg" alt=""/> <figcaption>A couple bows to show respect as they leave the shrine.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class="leftCaption"> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03763.jpg" alt=""/> <figcaption>Right behind the entrance lies a statue of Ōmura Masujirō, the father of the modern Japanese military.</figcaption> </figure> <p>There was quite a bit of police presence as there was an event of some sort happening that&nbsp;day.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03756.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03773.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03846.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03779.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03789.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <div class="embed-container" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2.1rem; display: block;"> <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/260162240?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <p>There was a gathering of nationalists hanging out, talking, and singing nationalist and war&nbsp;songs.</p> <p>One thing I found surprising was how many Self-Defense Force personnel openly associated with right-wing nationalist groups. These groups insist on a revisionist version of history where Japan never started the war and never committed war crimes. They also advocate for a much more expansive military, directly at odds with the mission of the Self-Defense&nbsp;Force.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03799.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03803.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure class="leftCaption"> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03810.jpg" alt=""/> <figcaption>Man in white passionately leads nationalists and sympathetic onlookers in song.</figcaption> </figure> <div class="embed-container" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2.1rem; display: block;"> <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/260162218?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/phone.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure class="leftCaption"> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03818.jpg" alt=""/> <figcaption>A grandma asks a teenager, dressed in an Imperial Japan uniform, to take a photo with her grandson (not pictured).</figcaption> </figure> <hr/> <p>Out of nowhere, it started raining apocalyptically and I had to take shelter in the cafeteria, which also doubled as a souvenir shop. Many Yakuza factions, aligned with nationalist groups, came to Yasukuni that day. We were trapped in the cafeteria together for almost two&nbsp;hours.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03826.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <p>The Yakuza operates largely in the open. They have offices that politicians visit, they own companies, operate whole neighborhoods, and they are in every part of Japanese&nbsp;society.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03827.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <p>Knowing all that, I still found it surprising that everyone was just nonchalantly mingling with them. In fact, I think one of them made some room for me as I tried to find a spot to eat some yakisoba (the cafeteria sold overpriced food and&nbsp;beer).</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03831.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03834.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03843.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03835.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <p>The cafeteria also had some pro-Abe posters. Amusingly, their Abe illustration of Abe made him look funny. Shouldn’t this kind of thing make him look&nbsp;flattering?</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03840.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <hr/> <p>As the rain slowed from a storm to a constant drizzle, I decided to go line up to see the actual&nbsp;shrine.</p> <figure class="leftCaption"> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03848.jpg" alt=""/> <figcaption>Filming is prohibited inside the grounds. Here, we see a television cameraman filming. I’m guessing he got special permission.</figcaption> </figure> <p>There were hundreds of people in line, and they were there even before the storm subsided. These are not old people who are products of the past, they are part of the younger generation who still fully subscribe to Japan’s pre-war&nbsp;philosophy.</p> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03854.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03868.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <figure> <img src="/images/yasukuni/DSC03870.jpg" alt=""/> </figure> <hr/> <p>As I write this, many Asian countries are turning away from democracy and human rights to embrace more authoritarian regimes. In countries like the Philippines and Thailand, the masses went to the polls to vote their own rights&nbsp;away.</p> <p>In Japan, Shinzō Abe is winning the fight to change Japan’s post-war pacifist constitution. This would lift restrictions on Japan’s military and would be a huge step backwards into the&nbsp;past.</p> <p>What is old is new&nbsp;again.</p> <p><br/><span class="black-60">Photos taken on August 15<sup>th</sup>,&nbsp;2017</span></p> <hr/> <h2 id="more-on-yasukuni-shrine">More on Yasukuni&nbsp;Shrine:</h2> <p><a href="http://www.japansubculture.com/yasukuni-shrine-the-nations-pacifying-shrine-that-angers-other-nations/" target="_blank">Japan Subculture Research Center’s&nbsp;Explainer</a> <br/> <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/photo-essay-yasukuni-shrine-15-august" target="_blank">Lowy Institute’s 15 August Photo&nbsp;Essay</a></p> </section> </article> </div> <footer class="db w-100 ph3-ns ph2-m ph4 cf bg-light-gray"> <div class="db center w-75-ns w-80-m w-100 bold f5-ns f6 lh-solid"> <div class="fl mv3 mr1 tl v-mid"> <a href="/seattle_mini_maker_faire/" class="link mid-gray hover-dark-gray"> <span class="v-mid">&#60;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seattle Mini Maker Faire</span> </a> </div> <div class="fr mv3 ml1 tr v-mid"> <a href="/seattle-mechanical-keyboard/" class="link mid-gray hover-dark-gray"> <span class="v-mid">Seattle Mechanical Keyboard Meetup&nbsp;&nbsp;&#62;</span> </a> </div> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>

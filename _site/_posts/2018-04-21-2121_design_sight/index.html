To the Japanese, Naoto is much more. He promotes design education and is a fixture in the Japanese scene. Naoto, together with fashion designer, Issey Miyaki, and graphic designer, Taku Satoh, founded the 21_21 <span class="caps">DESIGN</span> <span class="caps">SIGHT</span> museum, where they direct and curate each&nbsp;exhibit. 21_21 <span class="caps">DESIGN</span> <span class="caps">SIGHT</span> has rotating exhibits and I got a chance to see the “<span class="caps">GRAND</span> <span class="caps">PROJECTS</span>: <span class="caps">HOW</span> <span class="caps">FAR</span> <span class="caps">WILL</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">GO</span>?” exhibit. Grand Projects feature large-scale projects (hence the name “grand”) that inspire a sense of awe and wonder (“how far will you&nbsp;go?”). These projects are interesting because they strike the perfect balance between conceptual art and purposeful design. Through these works, we can explore how much more delightful and inspiring our daily lives can&nbsp;be. **** {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/15.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/4.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} An installation of glass wall, segmented into parts and filled with comfortable bedding and entertainment. There was even an overnight event where people could stay over, while people on the outside could&nbsp;watch. {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/1.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/2.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/3.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} Sure, it’s totally weird and voyeuristic, but having been inside, it’s oddly comfortable. There’s something with the soft sheets and the beautiful natural light and courtyard. It should be very uncomfortable but it&nbsp;isn’t. --- {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/5.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/6.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/7.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} A plastic cocoon made out of clear tape. It’s a resilient structure with a very interesting form. The cocoon flexes when people walk around inside, but it is secured with very strong metal&nbsp;parts. {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/8.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} The installation is an experience in itself. While lining up, you can hear voices and sounds of the people inside, but you have no idea what it’s like in there or what they’re&nbsp;doing. {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/9.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} It’s a mystery, and when you finally get to climb inside, it’s&nbsp;exciting. {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/10.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/design_sight/11.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} There are other design museums in Tokyo, but 21_21 stands out as the most interesting one. Other museums, like the Nezu Museum, boasts design work, but in reality are filled with historic paintings and artifacts, not design&nbsp;work. So, 21_21 is definitely worth a&nbsp;visit. </section> </article> </div> <footer class="db w-100 ph3-ns ph2-m ph4 cf bg-light-gray"> <div class="db center w-75-ns w-80-m w-100 dia-bold f5-ns f6 lh-solid"> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>

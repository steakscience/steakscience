Most are from the area, some fly in, and everyone brings their&nbsp;keyboards. Inside, there are dozens of tables where people display their keyboards alongside placards detailing the model, switch, keycaps, and other modifications. From there, people walk around and mingle, nerding out about keyboards, typing on them, and just having a great&nbsp;time. The mechanical keyboard community is one of the kindest and most helpful communities on the internet. There are many meetups around the world, and attending them provides an opportunity to meet people <span class="caps">IRL</span> and put their faces to their online&nbsp;names. ---- Behind each keyboard is a story; how it was built, what all the parts are, and why the person built it. I went around talking to awesome people and took their&nbsp;portraits. {% figure caption:"(Left) Magicforce 68 keys Mini keyboard, Maxkey Lime&nbsp;keycaps <br> (Right) <span class="caps">WASD</span> <span class="caps">V2</span> keyboard" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p1.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"60% Typewriter Wood Case, keycaps from Alibaba with chrome sides, <span class="caps">PIP</span> LEDs" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p2.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"(Left) Kinensis Advantage with vinyl&nbsp;sticker <br> (Right) Iris keyboard" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p3.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"<span class="caps">RAMA</span> <span class="caps">M65-A</span> keyboard, <span class="caps">GMK</span> Oblivion keycaps" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p4.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"Mech<span class="caps">27-TKL</span> keyboard, Gateron linear switches, <span class="caps">GMK</span> Plum keycaps" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p5.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"Mech<span class="caps">27-TKL-V1</span> keyboard, Brown Alps switches, custom acrylic plate, <span class="caps">SP</span> LightCycle keycaps" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p6.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"Apple <span class="caps">M0110</span> keyboard, custom <span class="caps">PCB</span> with Bluetooth, Gateron Yellow switches" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p<span class="caps">6-2</span>.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"Hardwired cork board, 67cN Zandas/Pealios, <span class="caps">GMK</span> Plum keycaps" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p7.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"(Left) Pok3r keyboard, Cherry Blue switches, grab bag&nbsp;keycaps <br>(Right) Unknown Sony video editing keyboard" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p8.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"(Left) Leopold <span class="caps">FC660M</span> keyboard, Cherry <span class="caps">MX</span> Brown switches, purple <span class="caps">WASD</span>&nbsp;keycaps <br>(Right) Genovation <span class="caps">CP24</span> <span class="caps">USB</span> <span class="caps">HID</span>, Cherry <span class="caps">MX</span> Black switches, Relegendable keycaps" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p9.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"<span class="caps">KBD</span> keyboard, Gateron Red switches, translucent top, side printed keycaps, dancing LEDs" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p10.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"<span class="caps">HHKB</span> Pro 2, orange spacebar, artisan and stock Topres (rubber domes) and keycaps." | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p11.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"<span class="caps">OLKB</span> Preonic keyboard, Adler Typewriter keycaps" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p12.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"<span class="caps">RAMA</span> <span class="caps">M65-O</span>, custom ortho <span class="caps">PCB</span> by /u/wootpatoot, 67g Zealio switches, <span class="caps">SA</span> Hyper-7/Symbiosis keycaps" | class:"leftCaption"&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/p<span class="caps">12-2</span>.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} ---- Some photos of the&nbsp;event: {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/c0.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/c1.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure&nbsp;%} ![](/images/smk/c2.jpg) {% endfigure&nbsp;%} {% figure caption:"This guy works at Github on the Atom team.

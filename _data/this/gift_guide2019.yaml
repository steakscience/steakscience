      - title: The New York Times Debossed Mug

        price: $32
        text:
            - p: Merch is often gaudy and garish. They serve as a shouting and screaming ad for the brand and worse, they’re not even free—you have to buy them.
            - p: However, this mug is so different because it’s understated. A gorgeous logo doesn’t need to scream. It can be subtle. In this case, it’s debossed on a mug.
            - p: So every morning, you can enjoy your coffee while supporting good journalism.

        text:

        text:
            - p: Wait, why would anyone get a dumb phone from a decade ago? Oh, don’t worry. You won’t be using it as a phone. It’ll be your new paper weight.
            - p: Nothing screams sophistication like a useless Blackberry. You’ll be putting this on your desk, atop the piles of important financial papers you’re surely working on.
            - p: This is the first Blackberry to incorporate metal. This is the Blackberry that [Kim Kardashian was stockpiling](https://qz.com/749927/kim-kardashians-out-of-production-blackberry-sold-out-on-ebay-and-she-doesnt-know-what-to-do/). So you can’t really go wrong with this.

        text:
            - p: If you’re an industrial design nerd, you’re already know you need this. But you might have reservations. Sure, it’s old and runs a dead OS, but like the Blackberry, you won’t be using it as a phone.
            - p: It’ll be your new bright yellow, Finnish-designed paperweight. At a higher price point that the Blackberry, this is our upgrade pick for eye-catching paperweights.
            - p: Now, when someone inquires about the phone on your desk, you can educate them on Aalto’s “gentler structure to life” philosophy. It’s true. Also, Nokia designed something incredible here and Satya Nadella killed the company. You can rant about that too.

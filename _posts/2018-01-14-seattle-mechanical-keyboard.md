Twice a year, mechanical keyboard enthusiasts [meetup in Seattle](https://ckeys.org/events/smkmeetup/). Most are from the area, some fly in, and everyone brings their keyboards.

Inside, there are dozens of tables where people display their keyboards alongside placards detailing the model, switch, keycaps, and other modifications. From there, people walk around and mingle, nerding out about keyboards, typing on them, and just having a great time.

The mechanical keyboard community is one of the kindest and most helpful communities on the internet. There are many meetups around the world, and attending them provides an opportunity to meet people IRL and put their faces to their online names.

Behind each keyboard is a story; how it was built, what all the parts are, and why the person built it. I went around talking to awesome people and took their portraits.

{% figure caption:"Artisan/novel keycaps are unique. Unlike regular keys which represent letters or symbols, artisans are color heads, faces, or even [ramen](https://imgur.com/gallery/vm7Y2).

{% figure caption:"There was a trivia for prizes. It was very fun and was quite casual. Not the nasty competitive kind.

This was my first meetup and I’m quite new and ignorant about keyboards. Nonetheless, people were always willing to answer questions. The community is awesome, and I had a blast.

I’m really really into songs written and released to promote movies.

It’s strange, these songs should suck. They are contrived, they’re not creatively inspired, and only exist to help artists make a quick buck (well, lots of quick bucks). However, it turns out, these songs are *really really good*. 

As movie blog [*Little White Lies* mentions](https://lwlies.com/articles/the-fall-and-rise-of-movie-tie-singles/){:target="_blank"}, some of these promotional songs actually gain lives of their own and become top singles in their release years. We’re talking about epic hits like Skyfall (the James Bond film), Happy (some children’s movie), and See You Again (the car movie).

Other promotional songs may not top the charts, but frankly, they’re also better most songs out there. Also, for whatever reason, *The Hunger Games* franchised produced a lot of great songs.

I’ve included my favorite promotional songs here, enjoy!

Every year, graduating UW Design students put together a show to exhibit their best work. 

This year, I’m part of the graduating class and I think we’ve put together an incredible show. We are showcasing critical, interesting, and wide-ranging work. There’s some great convention stuff, along with some more conceptual and vulnerable work on display.

You should come take a look. I think you’ll like it.

My capstone is also on display. What if children tablets are coffee tables?

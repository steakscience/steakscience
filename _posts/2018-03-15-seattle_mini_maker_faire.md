Every once in a while, some government somewhere bombastically declares that they’ll be creating the next Silicon Valley, along with announcing some kind of one-time investment (yeah, it’s going to take more commitment than that).

That’s not how it works. It takes culture, education, talent, and time. You can’t just dump money at a borough in some city somewhere. That’s why Silicon Valley cannot be replicated, at least not that easily.

I bring this up because this thought kept flowing through my head as I walked through the Maker Faire. A lot of the attendees were not middle-aged nerds, they were children and their eyes were full of wonder. These kids are going to grow up surrounded by cool tech, surrounded by opportunities to learn about them, and be awed at the possibilities. They are going to grow up to make some groundbreaking stuff one day. 

Really, this is how you make Silicon Valley.
